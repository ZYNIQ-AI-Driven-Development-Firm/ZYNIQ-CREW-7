      "title": "Upgrade Agent Graph (XYFlow) to Mature, Interactive Visualizer",
      "copilot_prompt": "You are enhancing the existing React XYFlow-based Agent Graph for Crew-7. Do NOT rewrite from scratch or break current behavior. Build on what exists and keep all current features working.\n\nGoals for the upgraded visualizer:\n1) Interactions & UX\n   - Keep the Orchestrator as the central/top node and the 6 specialists arranged in a clean, readable layout (radial or layered).\n   - Enable smooth pan + zoom (mouse wheel / trackpad) with sensible limits.\n   - Clicking a node should:\n     * Focus that agent (highlight node + dim others).\n     * Open a side panel or bottom drawer with agent details: role, description, current task, last messages, and recent tool calls.\n   - Hovering an edge should show a small tooltip with last few messages exchanged (shortened) and timestamps.\n   - Maintain dark / blueprint / neon styling. No white backgrounds.\n\n2) Live Run Timeline Integration\n   - Subscribe to the existing WebSocket/SSE events (agent_start, agent_end, tool_call, tool_result, message, error, etc.).\n   - On each event:\n     * Briefly glow/highlight the active node.\n     * Pulse or animate the edge between sender and receiver when a message or tool call happens.\n     * Update the side panel with the latest status and logs for the active agent.\n   - Add a small horizontal timeline scrubber (e.g. under the graph) that:\n     * Shows key events as dots (start, tool_call, error, finish).\n     * Allows scrubbing to replay a run visually (replaying node highlights and edge pulses without re-calling the backend).\n   - Keep playback and live mode simple for MVP: Live mode (default) + Replay mode (read-only from stored events).\n\n3) Layout & Readability\n   - Use XYFlow best practices: stable layout, controlled node positions, no jitter.\n   - Give each node:\n     * Agent name (e.g. \"Orchestrator\", \"Backend Architect\", \"QA Engineer\").\n     * Small robot avatar icon.\n     * Status badge (idle, running, error, done).\n   - Ensure graph resizes nicely with the window and in Advanced Mode split-screen with chat.\n\n4) Safety & Non-breaking Requirement\n   - Do NOT remove any existing graph functionality that is already wired.\n   - Keep all IDs and event types consistent with the backend.\n   - If some events are missing, fail gracefully (no crashes, just fewer animations).\n   - All styling must stay aligned with the existing dark, geometric, blueprint look.\n\nBefore committing, quickly scan current XYFlow components and only extend / refactor where absolutely needed. The goal is a more mature, interactive visualization that helps dev teams (like Atlas) debug and understand runs, not a total redesign."

      "title": "Code Canvas + Live Preview for Dev Teams (Atlas-style Workflow)",
      "copilot_prompt": "You are enhancing the existing code/artifact viewing area into a more powerful \"Code Canvas\" for Crew-7. This is for dev teams (like Atlas) to inspect, test, and validate generated artifacts. Reuse existing components where possible and do NOT break current UI.\n\nGoals for Code Canvas:\n1) Structure & Layout\n   - Add a split-pane or tabbed layout with:\n     * Left: file tree / artifact list (grouped by backend, frontend, tests, infra, docs).\n     * Center: code viewer/editor (read-only is enough for MVP, but keep the API flexible).\n     * Right or bottom: preview panel for web/HTML outputs when possible.\n   - Maintain dark theme with blueprint / grid background. No white backgrounds.\n\n2) File Tree & Run Context\n   - Fetch artifacts from the backend for a selected run (e.g. by mission_id or run_id).\n   - Show a simple file tree:\n     * Example groups: `/backend`, `/frontend`, `/tests`, `/infra`, `/docs`.\n     * Each leaf is a file that can be clicked to load into the viewer.\n   - Allow switching between different runs (for teams like Atlas to compare outputs across runs). For MVP, a simple dropdown with recent runs is enough.\n\n3) Code Viewer Features\n   - Use a proper code viewer with syntax highlighting (Monaco, Prism, or existing choice in the project).\n   - Show filename + language badge.\n   - Optional but nice: a simple diff mode between two runs for the same file (only if time allows; otherwise, keep in mind for later).\n\n4) Live Preview Panel\n   - For HTML/CSS/JS or React components that are previewable:\n     * Render them in an isolated iframe or a sandboxed React preview.\n     * Handle errors gracefully: show an error state instead of crashing the app.\n   - Provide a simple toggle: Code-only / Code+Preview.\n   - Ensure preview never blocks the main UI thread; keep it light.\n\n5) Integration with Agent Graph & Runs\n   - When a run is selected in the Agent Graph or chat, sync the Code Canvas to that run’s artifacts.\n   - Optionally show a small status hint like \"Artifacts last updated: [timestamp]\".\n   - Do NOT require page reloads; use client-side state and queries.\n\n6) Non-breaking & Smooth Integration\n   - Keep existing content and logic from the current UI (AI Studio-based) intact; wrap or extend instead of replacing wholesale.\n   - Reuse existing theme tokens, spacings, and typography.\n   - Ensure that if no artifacts are available, the Code Canvas shows a friendly empty state, not an error.\n\nThe goal: dev teams like Atlas can run a crew, watch the Agent Graph, then immediately open the Code Canvas to inspect real code and preview the generated UI—all within a smooth, cohesive Crew-7 experience without breaking any existing features."
