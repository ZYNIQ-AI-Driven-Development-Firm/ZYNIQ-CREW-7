      "title": "Crew-7 Overall Vision",
      "copilot_prompt": "Project context: This repository implements Crew-7, a multi-agent AI platform where structured crews of 7 agents (1 Orchestrator + 6 specialists) can design, build, and maintain solutions across multiple domains (software, marketing, business, finance, research).\n\nCore concept:\n- A \"Crew\" is a reusable, configurable 7-agent team.\n- Each crew combines: an Orchestrator (central planner) + 6 specialists.\n- Agents can communicate via a hybrid pattern: orchestrator-led (centralized) plus specialist-to-specialist (peer-to-peer) for efficiency.\n\nHigh-level goals:\n1) Users can pick a prebuilt crew (e.g., Backend Builder, Frontend Builder, Marketing Funnel Crew, Pitch Deck Crew, Finance/Analysis Crew) or create their own from scratch.\n2) A run executes the crew (powered by CrewAI or equivalent multi-agent engine + LLMs) to produce real artifacts (e.g., FastAPI scaffolds, Next.js UIs, campaigns, reports, business artifacts) using a secure tool sandbox.\n3) The UI has a normal Chat mode and an Advanced Mode with a visual agent graph: shows which agents are active, how they communicate, and the live flow of messages/tools.\n4) The platform is safe (resource-limited tools), multi-tenant (org/workspace aware), and observable (traces, metrics, logs, run history).\n5) There is a marketplace of prebuilt crews that can be installed, rented, or bought; each crew has metadata (skills, XP, portfolio, domain focus).\n6) The branding/UX is coherent: dark blueprint aesthetic, geometric lines, animated paths between sections, robot/agent faces for visualization.\n7) Web3 / tokenization (crew NFTs, on-chain XP, internal token) is a **future phase**, not a blocking part of the MVP; current focus is solid SaaS + marketplace in fiat.\n\nWhen editing any code in this repo, keep these constraints in mind:\n- Do not turn this app into a generic chat assistant. It must stay centered on structured multi-agent crews and running real missions that produce tangible outputs.\n- Prefer structured APIs and data models (crews, runs, tools, traces, marketplace items, connections, env vars) over one-off ad-hoc endpoints or UI hacks.\n- Preserve existing types and endpoints where possible; make changes additive and backwards compatible.\n- Keep the hybrid communication model (orchestrator + peer-to-peer) explicit in architecture and event streams where it matters.\n\nYour task whenever this prompt is present: before implementing any feature or refactor, check if it supports or conflicts with this vision. If it conflicts, suggest a design that stays aligned with Crew-7's goals instead."

      "title": "Backend Scope & Boundaries",
      "copilot_prompt": "Backend scope reminder for Crew-7.\n\nWhat the backend MUST do:\n1) Provide REST + SSE + WebSocket APIs to manage users, orgs, crews, runs, traces, tools, marketplace templates/items, LLM connections, and environment variables.\n2) Use CrewAI (or similar) as the multi-agent engine, with per-crew memory, a hybrid orchestrator+specialist communication model, and secure tool execution via Docker or a comparable sandbox.\n3) Expose tools such as git clone, pytest, bash, file operations, GitHub PR creation, simple HTTP calls, etc., in a controlled, resource-limited way.\n4) Persist run lifecycle (queued, running, succeeded, failed), detailed events (agent_start, agent_token, agent_end, tool_call, tool_result, edge/message), and artifacts (files, logs, summaries).\n5) Provide trace batching and filtering: trace batches, status/type filters, and run-level observability endpoints for the \"X\"/Mission Lab section (Traces, LLM Connections, Environment Variables).\n6) Support a minimal billing/credits model (per run or per token) and LLM connection management (per-org API keys, models, local models like Ollama where configured).\n7) Enable marketplace workflows: listing templates, installing templates into a workspace, and exposing metadata necessary for a future Web3 metadata schema (crew traits, XP, owner, etc.), while still working without any blockchain.\n\nWhat the backend MUST NOT do:\n- No heavy UI logic or templating; all presentation lives in the frontend.\n- No storing raw secrets in plain text; secrets must be sealed/encrypted and only exposed in masked or redacted form.\n- No long-running unbounded processes; everything must be time-limited and safe for multi-tenant use.\n- No hidden or implicit cross-tenant data sharing.\n\nWhen making backend changes, ensure new endpoints and services:\n- Fit the core nouns: crew, run, tool, trace, env var, llm connection, marketplace template/item, workspace/org.\n- Are idempotent where possible, and do not break existing clients (prefer additive fields/versions).\n- Are safe by default (limited CPU/RAM, restricted filesystem, explicit network allowlists, timeouts).\n- Emit consistent events so the frontend AgentGraph and Traces views can rely on them."

      "title": "Frontend Scope & UX Pillars",
      "copilot_prompt": "Frontend scope reminder for Crew-7.\n\nUX pillars:\n1) Simple default: a chat-first interface where a user can select a crew, type a goal/mission, and see streaming progress and results.\n2) Power mode: an Advanced Mode that reveals an agent graph (XYFlow/ReactFlow style), traces, and configuration for advanced users.\n3) Fast onboarding: guest or quick sign-up should land on a dashboard where a user can run a prebuilt crew (e.g., Backend Builder) in under 60 seconds.\n4) Consistent visual language: dark theme, blueprint-style geometric lines, minimal neon accents, robot avatars/faces for agents, clear status indicators (idle, running, failed, paused).\n5) Landing/marketing surface: a scroll-snapped, section-based landing page with a glassmorphic navbar, section indicator, and animated blueprint line that visually connects all sections using anime.js.\n\nCore pages/components:\n- Landing page: hero + ~8 sections, explained via Crew-7 story, marketplace, multi-domain use cases, and blueprint animations.\n- Dashboard: quick stats, recent runs, and quick actions (e.g., Backend Scaffold, Frontend Scaffold, Marketing Crew).\n- Chat / Command feed: streaming run output, agent identity indicators, controls to restart/modify mission; default view when running a crew.\n- Advanced Mode (AgentGraph): XYFlow-based graph of agents and edges, with pause/resume/cancel and (eventually) per-node configuration.\n- Marketplace: browse/install prebuilt crews, view crew portfolios/XP, install into workspace.\n- Mission Lab / X section: Traces (batches + filters), LLM Connections (providers, env-var based keys), Environment Variables management.\n- Settings: Account, Organization, Billing, Security, Integrations, Notifications.\n\nWhen editing frontend code:\n- Do not add random pages or flows that are not about crews, runs, marketplace, or their configuration.\n- Prefer composing existing components (cards, badges, avatars, blueprint backgrounds, graph widgets) over introducing new design systems.\n- Preserve the blueprint aesthetic: dark backgrounds, subtle lines, minimal color usage.\n- Always think: will this help a user run a crew successfully, understand what happened, or better evaluate/install a crew from the marketplace?"

      "title": "Advanced Mode & Agent Graph Goals",
      "copilot_prompt": "Advanced Mode / Agent Graph scope reminder.\n\nGoals:\n1) When no run is active, show only the chat or default view; the AgentGraph should be hidden or minimized to keep things simple.\n2) When a run is active and the user enables Advanced Mode, the chat shrinks and an interactive AgentGraph appears, showing all agents and edges.\n3) The graph is not just decorative: it must react to live events from the backend (agent_start, agent_token, agent_end, tool_call, edge/message) and visually highlight active nodes/edges.\n4) Power users can pause, resume, or cancel the run from the graph view, see which agent is currently executing, and inspect recent messages/tool calls.\n5) Over time, users can tweak prompts/tools per node or rewire the graph as a crew configuration (not just as transient run state).\n\nConstraints:\n- The AgentGraph for a given run should be mostly read-only in structure: edits that change graph topology should be saved as crew configuration (e.g., editing a crew builder view), not silently modify a live run in unsafe ways.\n- Do not block or slow down the main chat when Advanced Mode is enabled; the chat should remain fully usable while the graph is visible.\n- Keep the implementation aligned with XYFlow/ReactFlow best practices and Crew-7 styling: robot avatars for agents, neon/blueprint lines, minimal but clear interaction affordances.\n- WebSocket / SSE event handling should be centralized and robust; the graph should subscribe to the same run event stream the chat uses.\n\nWhenever modifying the AgentGraph or Advanced Mode logic, ensure it remains a helpful, live visualization and control surface for crew behavior — not a separate playground unrelated to real runs."

      "id": "crew7_marketplace_scope",
      "title": "Marketplace & Templates Goals",
      "copilot_prompt": "Marketplace scope reminder.\n\nGoals:\n1) Provide a curated set of prebuilt crews (e.g., Backend Builder Crew, Frontend Builder Crew, Marketing Launch Crew, Pitch Deck Crew, Research/ETL Crew) that users can install into their workspace with 1–2 clicks.\n2) Installing a template should create a configured crew that can run immediately with minimal setup (only LLM keys/env vars if required).\n3) Marketplace items should be understandable for non-experts: clear description of what the crew does, what inputs it expects, and what outputs it produces.\n4) Crews can eventually be rented or bought; each crew should have metadata like domain, difficulty, XP, run count, ratings, and creator.\n5) A Web3/ownership layer can later treat some crews as NFTs or tokenized assets with on-chain metadata (traits, XP, owners) and revenue splits, but this is a future enhancement, not required for MVP.\n\nConstraints:\n- Marketplace is about reusable crew definitions and configurations (graph, prompts, tools, roles), not arbitrary unreviewed code snippets.\n- Installing a template must never overwrite or delete existing user crews; it should create a new crew instance or clearly versioned copy.\n- All marketplace crews must respect the same safety and sandbox rules as user-defined crews (tool limits, resource caps, org isolation).\n- The backend must expose enough metadata to support both a traditional marketplace UI and, later, a Web3 metadata schema for crews.\n\nWhen adding or editing marketplace-related code, treat templates as first-class crews with clear, serializable definitions. Keep the first version simple and robust so we can later scale to more complex pricing, rating, and ownership models without rewriting everything."
