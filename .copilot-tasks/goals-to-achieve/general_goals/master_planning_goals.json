No UI code leaks into backend; no backend logic leaks into UI.\n\n2) Every module must be modular, coherent, and purposeful. No God-files. The system should read like a well-orchestrated crew: crews, runs, traces, events, tools, marketplace, secrets, billing.\n\n3) Public API must remain stable. When upgrading or refactoring, always introduce new versions instead of breaking old ones. No unexpected breaking changes.\n\n4) Observability is a first-class citizen. Every agent action, event, tool call, lifecycle transition, and API request must leave a trace. Logs must have timestamps, IDs, and types.\n\n5) The agent communication architecture must follow the Hybrid Model: orchestrator-led decision-making with direct specialist-to-specialist exchanges where efficient. The backend event system must reflect this clearly.\n\n6) All execution must happen inside safe, resource-limited sandboxes. Timeouts, RAM caps, CPU limits, and restricted networking must be applied consistently.\n\nCopilot: All architectural changes must be incremental, reversible, and follow these guardrails strictly. Reject suggestions that introduce coupling, performance risks, or unsafe execution paths."

Large tasks must be split.\n\n3) No developer should remain blocked for more than 4 hours. If blocked, escalate immediately.\n\n4) No new feature can enter a sprint unless it clearly supports:\n   - Crew execution reliability\n   - Graph accuracy\n   - Marketplace install flow\n   - User onboarding experience\n\n5) Advanced animations, blueprint effects, and deep polish should only be integrated after core UX works end-to-end.\n\n6) Copilot must always propose the simplest practical implementation. No over-engineering or speculative complexity.\n\nCopilot: When generating or modifying tasks, ensure they respect timeline expectations, map to a pillar, and avoid scope expansion."
