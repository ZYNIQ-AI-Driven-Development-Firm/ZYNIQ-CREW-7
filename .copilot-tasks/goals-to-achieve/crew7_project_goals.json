      "title": "Crew-7 Overall Vision",
      "copilot_prompt": "Project context: This repository implements Crew-7, a multi-agent AI platform where structured crews of 7 agents (1 Orchestrator + 6 specialists) can design, build, and maintain software systems.\n\nHigh-level goals:\n1) Users can pick a prebuilt crew (e.g., Backend Builder, Frontend Builder) or create their own crew.\n2) A run executes the crew (powered by CrewAI + LLMs) to produce real artifacts (e.g., FastAPI scaffolds, Next.js UIs, tests) using a secure tool sandbox.\n3) The UI has a normal Chat mode and an Advanced Mode with a visual agent graph, showing which agents are active and how they communicate.\n4) The platform is safe (resource-limited tools), multi-tenant (org/workspace aware), and observable (traces, metrics, logs).\n5) There is a small marketplace of prebuilt crews that can be installed into a workspace.\n\nWhen editing any code in this repo, keep these constraints in mind:\n- Do not turn this app into a generic chat assistant. It must stay centered on multi-agent crews and building real projects.\n- Prefer structured APIs (crews, runs, tools, traces, marketplace) over one-off ad-hoc endpoints.\n- Preserve existing types and endpoints where possible; make changes additive and backwards compatible.\n\nYour task whenever this prompt is present: before implementing any feature or refactor, check if it supports or conflicts with this vision. If it conflicts, suggest a design that stays aligned with Crew-7's goals instead."

      "title": "Backend Scope & Boundaries",
      "copilot_prompt": "Backend scope reminder for Crew-7.\n\nWhat the backend MUST do:\n1) Provide REST + SSE + WebSocket APIs to manage users, orgs, crews, runs, traces, tools, and marketplace templates.\n2) Use CrewAI (or similar) as the multi-agent engine, with per-crew memory and secure tool execution via Docker sandbox.\n3) Expose tools such as git clone, pytest, bash script, and GitHub PR creation in a controlled, resource-limited way.\n4) Persist run lifecycle (queued, running, succeeded, failed), events (agent_start, agent_end, tool calls), and artifacts.\n5) Support a minimal billing model (credits per run) and basic LLM connection management (per-org API keys/models).\n\nWhat the backend MUST NOT do:\n- No heavy UI logic or templating; all presentation lives in the frontend.\n- No storing raw secrets in plain text; secrets must be sealed/encrypted and only exposed in masked form.\n- No long-running unbounded processes; everything must be time-limited and safe for multi-tenant use.\n\nWhen making backend changes, ensure new endpoints and services:\n- Fit the nouns: crew, run, tool, trace, env var, llm connection, template.\n- Are idempotent where possible, and do not break existing clients.\n- Are safe by default (limited CPU/RAM, restricted filesystem, no unexpected network access)."

      "title": "Frontend Scope & UX Pillars",
      "copilot_prompt": "Frontend scope reminder for Crew-7.\n\nUX pillars:\n1) Simple default: a chat-first interface where a user can select a crew, type a goal, and see streaming progress.\n2) Power mode: an Advanced Mode that reveals an agent graph, traces, and configuration for advanced users.\n3) Fast onboarding: guest or quick sign-up should land on a dashboard where a user can run a prebuilt crew in under 60 seconds.\n4) Consistent visual language: dark theme, neon accents, robot avatars for agents, clear status indicators (available, running, failed).\n\nCore pages/components:\n- Dashboard: quick stats + quick actions (Backend Scaffold, Frontend Scaffold).\n- Chat / Command feed: streaming run output, controls to restart/modify prompt.\n- Advanced Mode (AgentGraph): XYFlow-based graph of agents and edges, with pause/resume/cancel and basic editing.\n- Marketplace: browse/install prebuilt crews.\n- Mission Lab: Traces, LLM Connections, Environment Variables.\n- Settings: Account, Organization, Billing, Security, Integrations, Notifications.\n\nWhen editing frontend code:\n- Do not add random pages or flows that are not about crews, runs, or their configuration.\n- Prefer composing existing components (cards, badges, avatars, graph) over introducing new design systems.\n- Always think: will this help a user run a crew successfully and understand what happened?"

      "title": "Advanced Mode & Agent Graph Goals",
      "copilot_prompt": "Advanced Mode / Agent Graph scope reminder.\n\nGoals:\n1) When no run is active, show only the chat view; the AgentGraph should be hidden or minimized.\n2) When a run is active, Advanced Mode can be toggled on: the chat shrinks, and an interactive graph shows all agents and their connections.\n3) The graph is not just decorative: it should react to live events from the backend (agent_start, agent_end, edge(message)) and visually highlight activity.\n4) Power users can pause, resume, or cancel the run, adjust the graph layout, and eventually tweak prompts/tools per node.\n\nConstraints:\n- The AgentGraph is read-only for the current run except for control actions (pause/resume/cancel); structural edits should be persisted as crew configuration, not just transient graph state.\n- Do not block or slow down the main chat when Advanced Mode is enabled.\n- Keep the graph implementation aligned with XYFlow/ReactFlow best practices and Crew-7 styling (robot avatars, neon lines).\n\nWhenever modifying the AgentGraph or Advanced Mode logic, ensure it remains a helpful, live visualization of crew behavior and not a separate, unrelated feature."

      "copilot_prompt": "Marketplace scope reminder.\n\nGoals:\n1) Provide a small but high-impact set of prebuilt crews (e.g., Backend Builder, Frontend Builder, Simple ETL) that users can install into their workspace.\n2) Installing a template should create a configured crew that can run immediately with minimal setup.\n3) Marketplace items should be described in a way that is understandable for non-experts (what the crew does, inputs, outputs).\n\nConstraints:\n- Marketplace is about reusable crew definitions and configurations, not arbitrary code snippets.\n- Installing a template should never overwrite or delete existing user crews.\n- All marketplace crews must respect the same safety and sandbox rules as user-defined crews.\n\nWhen adding or editing marketplace-related code, make sure templates are treated as first-class crews and kept simple enough for an MVP."
